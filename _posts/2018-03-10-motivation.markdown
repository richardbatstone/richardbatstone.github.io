This is not intended to be a blog about how we should ‘regulate AI’. 

Instead, it is my attempt to bridge the knowledge gap between, on the one hand, developers and research scientists working in and around the field of AI and, on the other, lawyers, regulators and policy makers who need to come to informed views about how AI is being deployed and the risks and opportunities it brings. That is, the knowledge gap that is epitomised by the following (erroneous) intuitions:

+ _"The GDPR regulates how AI can be deployed in business."_
+ _"iPhone face-recognition is racist."_

I will try and do this by taking concrete examples and looking at them in some detail, rather than general thought pieces that tend to propagate intuitions like those above. As an aside, I am also fascinated by linguistics and language processing, so I will be writing about this too (and will, no doubt, get overly excited when these two strands collide).
